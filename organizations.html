    <p>
        Every club and organization I have involved myself with has been for the purpose of improving my own character. In every organization I have been able to mature my technical, teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. Most organizations I participated in lead to leadership positions. A full list of all organizations over the years are here: ASB, Destination Imagination, Science Club, SkillsUSA, CSF, Water Polo, HPS, and Triton Robotics.
