    <p>
        In every team project I have been involved in, I have always emerged as a significant contributor. It is always my intention and my passion to put by best foot forward I everything I do. Working and learning from others within every team has only matured both my technical and soft skills. In several team projects highlighted in this portfolio, I have acted as the lead engineer. In other projects the combined group effort has lead to much astounding success that is always more amazing to share with a team.
