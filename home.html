        My passion for the sciences, math, and engineering began from the very beginning. The mechanics and physical phenomenas of the universe and world around me were not enough to just observe. From the moment I could speak I was eager to learn more. My first "complete" sentence was "How work?". I was fascinated by the environment around me and determined to understand it. This desire only matured into a clear focus of continuing forward in pursuing the ever advancing technology and innovation the world was producing. My passion guided my journey to leadership in most of the clubs and orgs I involved myself in. My educational journey concluded with graduated with my masters in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Controls and Mechatronics. I have since held internships at Hologic and Valitus Technologies as well as a summer research position under professor Morimoto for medical soft robotics. Right out of college I held a small position as a Hardware Engineer for Amazon Robotics. I transitioned however to my current career where I reside as a Mechanical Engineer II at Monarch Quantum in San Diego.

        Although by both appearance and paper, I hold the characteristics of being a nerd, this is not my entire story. I am a two time MVP for my high school's water polo team. I continued to play competitive water polo at my men's club team leading it as the club's president. I believe my active lifestyle significantly influences my character, actions, and performance.

        I can confidently say I am who I am today because of the household I was raised in. I mostly contribute my identity to my strong family connection and association with the Christian faith. Supportive parents have provided the initial spark that has with personal dedication rocketed me into who I am today.
