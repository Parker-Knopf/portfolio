    <p>
        The various projects highlighted here with exception to one have been entirely conducted solely through my own will and ambition. My strive to become a more accomplished, well rounded, and experienced engineer encouraged the development of these personal projects, encompassing everything from research, design, manufacturing, electrical engineering, and computer programming. The success of every project is a direct result of personal self-taught skills, problem solving through root-cause analysis and countless hours of dedicated work.
